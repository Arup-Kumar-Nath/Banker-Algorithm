# Banker-Algorithm
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes a “safe-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue. Following Data structures are used to implement the Banker’s Algorithm: Let ‘n’ be the number of processes in the system and ‘m’ be the number of resources types.
